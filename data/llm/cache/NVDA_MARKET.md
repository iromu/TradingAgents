The analysis of NVDA (NVIDIA) involves selecting indicators that provide complementary insights into trend, momentum,
volatility, and volume. After retrieving stock data, the following indicators were chosen for their distinct roles:

1. **close_50_sma**: Identifies medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance levels. Current price action
   shows a slight pullback toward the 50 SMA, suggesting potential consolidation.
2. **close_200_sma**: Acts as a long-term trend benchmark. NVDA remains well above its 200 SMA, confirming an overall
   bullish trend.
3. **macd**: Detects momentum shifts via crossovers. The MACD line is above the signal line, indicating continued
   positive momentum.
4. **macdh**: Visualizes momentum strength. The histogram is expanding, suggesting accelerating bullish momentum.
5. **rsi**: Flags overbought/oversold conditions. RSI is currently at 62, indicating moderate momentum without extreme
   overbought conditions.
6. **boll**: Bollinger Middle Band (20 SMA) serves as a dynamic benchmark. Price is trading near the upper band,
   suggesting potential short-term overbought pressure.
7. **atr**: Measures volatility for stop-loss adjustments. ATR is at 12.5, reflecting high volatility in NVDA's recent
   performance.
8. **vwma**: Confirms trends using volume-weighted price. The VWMA aligns with the close_50_sma, reinforcing the
   medium-term bullish trend.

**Key Observations**:

- The 50 SMA and VWMA alignment suggests strong short-to-medium term momentum.
- MACD and expanding histogram indicate accelerating bullish momentum, though RSI remains below overbought thresholds (
  70), reducing immediate reversal risk.
- Bollinger Bands show price near the upper band, but ATR's high volatility suggests potential for continued upward
  movement rather than a reversal.
- The 200 SMA confirms a long-term bullish trend, with no signs of a death cross.
