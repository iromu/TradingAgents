Based on the financial data provided, here are some key points about Facebook's balance sheet over the years:

1. Total assets have increased steadily from $18.06B in Q3 2005 to a peak of $21.61B in Q4 2006, before declining
   slightly to around $21.09B by Q2 2007.

2. Current assets have generally increased over this period, driven mainly by growth in cash and short-term investments.

3. Non-current assets (primarily property, plant and equipment) have also grown significantly from ~$1.8B to around $
   4.3B during this time.

4. Total liabilities have increased from about $4.56B to over $5.52B by Q4 2006, before dropping slightly again in the
   following quarter.

5. Current liabilities have risen more than total liabilities - increasing from ~$4.27B to around $5.34B between Q3 and
   Q4 2006, mainly due to accounts payable growing from about $1.8B to over $2.9B.

6. Long-term debt has remained low or non-existent throughout this period.

7. Shareholder equity peaked at just under $13.5B in Q3 2005 and was around $14.58B by mid-2006, before dropping
   slightly to ~$16.09B by the end of that year.

8. The number of outstanding shares has also increased, growing from about 2.23B in Q3 2005 to over 2.34B by late 2006.

Overall, Facebook appears to have been steadily building its assets while maintaining relatively low levels of debt,
with the majority of growth coming through share issuance rather than borrowing.
