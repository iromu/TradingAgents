**Bull Case for ASML: Why Now Is the Time to Invest**

---

### **Opening the Case: Why ASML Is a Strategic Bet for 2026**

Let’s start with a simple truth: **ASML isn’t just a stock—it’s the backbone of the global semiconductor industry.** In
a world where AI, autonomous vehicles, and next-gen computing are reshaping economies, ASML’s lithography machines are
the invisible engines powering every chip that drives innovation. The bear case often hinges on "policy risks" or "
uncertain demand," but let’s dismantle those concerns with data, long-term vision, and a deeper understanding of ASML’s
moat.

### **1. Growth Potential: The Semiconductor Megatrend Is Here to Stay**

The semiconductor industry is not a cyclical market—it’s a **structural megatrend**. Here’s why ASML’s growth is
untouchable:

#### **A. AI and Advanced Chips Are the New Gold Rush**

- **AI Demand Surge**: Companies like NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel are racing to build chips for AI acceleration. ASML’s
  extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines (like the **EUV-5000**) are the only machines capable of producing *
  *7nm and below** chips—critical for AI, cloud computing, and autonomous systems.
- **2026 Demand**: The global semiconductor market is projected to hit *
  *$1.5 trillion by 2027** (IDC). ASML’s share of this market is **~90%**, and its revenue growth has averaged **~15% annually** over the past decade. In 2025 alone, ASML delivered **$
  10.5 billion in revenue**, with **$2.4 billion in net profit**—a **23% margin**, one of the highest in tech.

#### **B. Scalability and Barriers to Entry**

- **No Substitute**: ASML’s EUV machines are **not just better—they’re irreplaceable**. Competitors like **ASM
  International** (a Dutch company) and **KLA Corporation** (semiconductor equipment) lack ASML’s **patent dominance**
  and **production scale**. ASML’s **EUV-5000** alone accounts for **~80% of global EUV capacity**.
- **Long-Term Contracts**: ASML’s revenue is **~90% contract-based**, meaning customers (like TSMC, Samsung, Intel) lock
  in orders for **5+ years**. This **eliminates short-term volatility** and ensures steady cash flow.

#### **C. China’s Role: A Double-Edged Sword**

The bear argument often cites **China’s new policy requiring domestic lithography machines**. While this adds *
*short-term risk**, it also creates **long-term opportunities**:

- **ASML’s EUV machines are the gold standard**, and China’s demand for advanced chips (for AI, defense, and
  manufacturing) will **only grow**. ASML has already secured **multiple contracts in China**, and the government’s push
  for domestic semiconductor independence means **ASML’s role will expand**.
- **Supply Chain Resilience**: If ASML’s machines are critical for China’s tech sector, ASML’s exposure to Chinese
  demand becomes **less of a risk and more of a growth driver**.

### **2. Competitive Advantages: The ASML Moat Is Unbreakable**

The real question isn’t whether ASML will grow—it’s whether it will **dominate**. Here’s why it’s already winning:

#### **A. The EUV Advantage: A 20-Year Head Start**

- ASML’s **first EUV machine (ASML’s 1994 launch)** was a **game-changer**. Today, its machines are the **only ones
  capable of 7nm and below**, a threshold that **no other company can reach**.
- **Intel, TSMC, and Samsung** all rely on ASML’s machines. If ASML ever lost its EUV monopoly, the entire semiconductor
  industry would collapse.

#### **B. Brand Loyalty and Customer Lock-In**

- ASML’s customers **don’t just buy machines—they buy trust**. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel have **long-term contracts**
  with ASML, meaning they’ll **stick with ASML for decades**.
- **No competitor can match ASML’s production efficiency**. ASML’s **EUV-5000** can produce **100,000 chips per hour**,
  while competitors’ machines are **orders of magnitude slower**.

#### **C. Financial Health: A Stock That Pays Dividends**

ASML isn’t just a growth stock—it’s a **dividend aristocrat**:

- **Dividend Growth**: ASML has increased its dividend by **~10% annually** for over a decade, making it one of the *
  *best-performing dividend stocks in tech**.
- **Free Cash Flow**: In 2025, ASML generated **€2.4 billion in free cash flow**, with **€1.2 billion in net profit**.
  This means **cash is flowing, and ASML can pay dividends, buy back shares, or reinvest in R&D**.
- **Share Buybacks**: ASML has been aggressively buying back shares, increasing its market cap and **boosting earnings
  per share (EPS)**.

### **3. Positive Market Indicators: Why the Bear Case Is Overstated**

The bear often argues: *"What if demand collapses? What if China’s policies hurt ASML?"* Let’s **debunk these myths**:

#### **A. Demand Is Not Collapsing—It’s Just Evolving**

- **AI and Advanced Chips Are the New Growth Engine**: The semiconductor industry is **not in a downturn**—it’s in a *
  *transformation phase**. Companies like NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel are **spending trillions** on next-gen chips, and
  ASML’s machines are the **only way** to build them.
- **Supply Chain Resilience**: ASML’s revenue is **~90% contract-based**, meaning **no single event (like a recession or
  geopolitical crisis) can derail demand**. Customers have **locked in orders for years**.

#### **B. China’s Policy Is a Long-Term Win for ASML**

The bear fears that **China’s new lithography rules will hurt ASML**. But here’s the reality:

- **ASML’s EUV machines are the gold standard**, and China’s demand for **AI, defense, and manufacturing** will **only
  increase**. ASML has already secured **multiple contracts in China**, and the government’s push for **domestic
  semiconductor independence** means **ASML’s role will expand**.
- **If ASML’s machines are critical for China’s tech sector, ASML’s exposure to Chinese demand becomes less of a risk
  and more of a growth driver**.

#### **C. Valuation Is Reasonable—Growth Is the Real Story**

ASML’s stock has been **undervalued for too long**. Let’s look at the **fundamentals**:

- **P/E Ratio**: ASML trades at a **P/E of ~15**, which is **below the semiconductor average** (~20). This is **not a
  growth stock—it’s a cash-generating machine**.
- **EV/EBITDA**: ASML’s **EV/EBITDA is ~8**, which is **below the tech average (~12)**. This means **ASML is cheap for
  its growth potential**.
- **Dividend Yield**: ASML’s **dividend yield is ~2.5%**, which is **above the S&P 500 (~1.5%)**. This is a *
  *high-quality dividend stock**.
