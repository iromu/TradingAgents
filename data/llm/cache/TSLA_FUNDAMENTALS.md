  160,700 (as of the latest data point available).

### Revenue Per Share:

  earnings growth from this company.

- **Evaluate Revenue Growth:** Given the positive trend in revenue, focus on understanding what drove this growth (e.g.,
  new markets, product diversification).
- **Consider Market Expectations:** High forward P/E might indicate that investors see significant potential for
  earnings growth. However, this should be balanced against current financial metrics.
