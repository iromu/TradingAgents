Based on the financial data provided, here are some key points about Siemens's gross profit and total revenue from 2005
to 2023 (the latest available year):

Gross Profit:

- Ranged from a low of €196.99 million in Q3 2005 to a high of €25.15 billion in FY 2023
- Generally showed an upward trend over this period

Total Revenue:

- Range: From a low of €5.33 billion in Q3 2005 to a high of €178.69 billion in FY 2023
- Strongly increased throughout the period, especially after 2014

Notable Observations:

1. Both gross profit and revenue experienced significant growth since 2014.
2. The ratio of gross profit to total revenue has improved over time, indicating better cost management or more
   profitable operations.
3. Q4 results often show higher values compared to other quarters, suggesting seasonal business patterns.

These figures provide a broad overview of Siemens's financial health and performance from 2005 to 2023, but for more
detailed analysis, specific ratios like gross profit margin would be useful. Would you like me to extract any particular
metrics or perform additional calculations on this data?
