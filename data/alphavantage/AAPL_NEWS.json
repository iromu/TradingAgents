It utilizes a flexible option overlay and tax-efficient return of capital distributions, allowing for participation in bull markets while generating substantial income. The article positions GPIX as a more aggressive, higher-beta income tool compared to peers like JEPI, suitable for investors comfortable with equity volatility in exchange for higher cash yield and S&P 500 upside participation.",

This decision, made due to financial concerns and a desire to pursue his own projects, means he missed out on a fortune. Today, that stake would be worth between $75 billion and $400 billion, highlighting one of history's biggest missed financial opportunities.",
