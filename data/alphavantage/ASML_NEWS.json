This optimistic outlook comes despite ongoing concerns about China's push for domestic chip equipment and ASML's expected decline in Chinese net sales in 2026.",

This policy, though flexible, heightens policy risk for equipment manufacturers like ASML, despite its dominance in lithography. Investors are now keenly awaiting ASML's Q4 and full-year 2025 financial results on January 28 for guidance on 2026 demand and customer spending plans.",
