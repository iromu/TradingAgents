Lunch is for wimps.
The most valuable commodity I know of is information.
It’s a Zero Sum game — somebody wins, somebody loses.
I create nothing. I own.
You’re walking around blind without a cane, pal.
Money never sleeps, pal.
This is the kid — calls me 59 days in a row, wants to be a player.
There is no nobility in poverty anymore.
You could’ve been one of the great ones, buddy.
What else you got besides connections at the airport?
Showdowns bore me, Larry. Nobody wins.
I want you surprised. Astonish me, pal.
Greed is good. Lunch is for wimps. Money never sleeps, pal.
If you’re not inside, you’re outside.
I create nothing. I own.
The most valuable commodity I know of is information.
What’s worth doing is worth doing for money.
You’re walking around blind without a cane.
Poor, smart, hungry — and no feelings.
It’s all about bucks, kid.
The rest is conversation.
Kid, you’re on a roll.
Enjoy it while it lasts.
Don’t get emotional about stock.
I look at a hundred deals a day. I pick one.
This is the kid — calls me 59 days in a row.
Wake up, will you pal? If you’re not inside, you’re outside.
